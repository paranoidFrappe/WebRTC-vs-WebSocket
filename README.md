# WebSocket vs. WebRTC Video Streaming Latency Comparison

Welcome to the My Techtalk live demo, where we'll compare the latency of video streaming using WebSocket and WebRTC.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to run the demo:

- **Step 1:** Download or clone this entire folder to your local machine.


- **Step 2:** Install Dependencies! Please open your terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```

- **Step 3:** Start up the server! Please run the following command on your terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```


- **Step 4:** Go to localhost:8000, and you can make a choice to go to which branch you prefer

> Or, you may go to localhost:8000/stream directly for hosting the video streaming via WebSocket.

> Also, you may go to localhost:8000/view directly for representing a audience of the video streaming via WebSocket. (You may open localhost:8000/view as much as possible to have fun)

- **Step 5:** For the WebRTC, Please go to /WebRTC client folder, there is another README for WebRTC video streaming.
