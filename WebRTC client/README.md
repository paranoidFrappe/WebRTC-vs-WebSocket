# WebRTC Handshaking Progress Demo

This is a demo page for the handshaking progress before WebRTC communication between different browsers.

## How to Use

- Open `webRTC_demo.html` and `webRTC_demo2.html` directly without running the server to experience peer-to-peer communication.

- **Step 1:** On the file `webRTC_demo.html`, click the button "Click me to generate an SDP of client A!" to generate an SDP (Session Description Protocol) object in the pink textarea named "This is the SDP of client A". Copy this SDP object.

- **Step 2:** Go to the file `webRTC_demo2.html` and paste the copied SDP object into the pink textarea named "Receiving the SDP from client A".

- **Step 3:** On the same `webRTC_demo2.html`, click the button "Generate an SDP of client B!" to generate an SDP object in the baby blue textarea named "This is the SDP of client B". Copy this SDP object.

- **Step 4:** Go back to the file `webRTC_demo.html` and paste the copied SDP object into the baby blue textarea named "Waiting for SDP from client B".

- **Step 5:** On the same `webRTC_demo.html`, click the button "Got the answer from another client *~>W0" to see the consequence of signaling for WebRTC communication.

> Note: This demo is intended for educational purposes to understand the handshaking process in WebRTC communication.
